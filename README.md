# USA Inflation-forecast

What we are currently working on? :nerd_face:
- We are currently working on forecasting the inflation in consumer prices for USA by studying data from the past 61 years. The data that we are using to forecast is collected and curated by The World Bank organization. We can find the link to the data at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG
- This is important to understand the monetary policies. Since monetary policy transmission is associated with significant lags, central banks aiming to achieve price stability need to be forward-looking in their decisions as well â€“ which underscores the importance of inflation forecasting.
-  We will consider historical yearly data for USA from 1960 upto 1920 and basis this we will forecast the inflation for 2021.
- To measure the accuracy of the forecast, we'll be using the Root Mean Square error method which shows the average of the squared difference between the original and predicted values in the data set.
- The forecast will have a point specific outcome.
