# USA Inflation-forecast

What we are currently working on? :nerd_face:
- We are currently working on forecasting the inflation in consumer prices for USA by studying data from the past 60 years. This is a key step in understanding the monetary policies which can be implemented by the government.
- To measure the accuracy of the forecast, we'll be using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) method.
- The data we are using has been collected from the World Bank Organisation.
- This is important to understand the monetary policies. Since monetary policy transmission is associated with significant lags, central banks aiming to achieve price stability need to be forward-looking in their decisions as well â€“ which underscores the importance of inflation forecasting.
